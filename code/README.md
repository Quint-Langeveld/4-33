## The code works as follows:

### Use the following for running:

```
python main.py field#.txt <algorithm>

### Or if the upper causes errors:

```
python main.py field#.txt <algorithm>
```

### After running with this command the user will be prompted for preferences, depending on the algorithm:
```
Breadthfirst: With or without saving the moves made by the alogrithm and with or without a visualization of the solution.
Branch and Bound: With or without a visualization of the best solution.
