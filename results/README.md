# Results

## Distributions
For the first three fields we ran a random algorithm to find oud the solution distribution in the state space. The results are displayed in the following graphs:

## Running time and Objective function
Running times and objective functions are calculated and shown in bar charts below for several algorithms. For now only our own created field (field 0) is used to determine the running time as well as the objective function.
