My Project:
Seven problems are given on a 6x6, 9x9 and 12x12 grid with a fixed setup of cars/trucks. There is one exit on the grid and we are supposed to find the best solution of the given problems. Cars and trucks, respectively a length of two and three, can only move horizontally or vertically depending on their fixed position from the start. Cars and trucks can't jump or move through other vehicles on the grid to find the best solution.

Getting Started:
Prerequisites:
This codebase is fully written in Python3.6.3. In requirements.txt are all necessary packages included to run the code succesfully. These are easily installed via the provided instruction below:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
Structure:
All Python scripts are stored in the folder Code. All input values can be found in the map Data where the map Results hold the  obtained results from the code.

Testing:
To run the code with a standardconfiguration use the instruction below, where one of the seven problems and the used algorithm should be defined: 
  python rushour.py <field>.text <algorithm>
